    <p>
        Healthy food is the foundation of a strong and active life. It includes a
        balanced intake of nutrients such as carbohydrates, proteins, fats,
        vitamins, and minerals that our body needs to grow, repair itself, and
        function properly. Foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, pulses,
        milk, and nuts provide energy and protect us from diseases. Eating healthy
        food helps in maintaining a healthy weight, improving immunity, and
        increasing concentration and stamina. In today's fast-food lifestyle,
        choosing healthy food is very important to stay physically fit and
        mentally strong.
